Take any vegetables that you like. If they cook slowly, like celeriac or eggplant, pre-cook or pre-fry them before using them in the recipe. Pepper, tomatoes, zucchini and celery can be used directly. Depending on the time the chosen vegetables cook until done in a frying pan, add them into a well-heated pan covered with oil before or after an amount of onions of your choice (onions are done within five minutes). Fry the vegetables until about to be done and add some salt. Take some eggs and either scramble them with whole milk or break them up onto the vegetables directly that should be piled up or pushed together in the middle of the pan. Add salt and dry herbs and, if eggs were added directly, mix them very gently with the vegetables. Decrease the temperature considerably and add a lid on top of the pan. Wait seven to ten minutes and voil√†, you have your omelette.
